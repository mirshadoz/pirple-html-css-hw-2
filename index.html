<h1>Ingredients for Polo</h1>
  <p>This is our traditional East Turkistan's dish called Polo. It is very healthy and tasty, gives much energy for work and amazing taste. It is usually served with side salad. It is one of my favourite dishes and I can eat it half a pot, easily! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BljmNB7.png" width="50px"></p>

  <p>Polo, looks so organic orange and warm color of taste, with it's beautifully cooked rice. Fried and steamed meat at the top, gives this dish visual effect and assurance of real joy for meat lovers. Also, would like to note that this dish can be cooked for vegeterians as well, they simply won't add meat, but eat and enjoy Polo itself by its each bite.</p>
  <p>For your reference, I would like to share some images of ready Polo below, enjoy!</p>
